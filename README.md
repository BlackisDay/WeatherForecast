# WeatherForecast

In this repository, the code that i have created is a WeatherForecast that will be able to check the next 5 days of weather. It will also show the name of the previous cities that you have searched. Although it may not be perfect or pretty. The code is still being worked on and one day it will be finished so that is completely pretty and perfectly working so that way we can show, everything including sea level.
